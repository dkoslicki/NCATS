# RTX Reasoning Tool proof-of-concept (POC) software

The RTX Reasoning Tool POC software is being collaboratively developed by a 
[team of investigators](https://github.com/dkoslicki/NCATS#rtx-leadership-team) 
at Oregon State University, the Institute for Systems Biology, and Ohio
State University.

## Organization of this repository

### subdirectory `code`

All software code files for the RTX proof-of-concept (POC) are accessible (and
version-controlled) under this subdirectory. The RTX POC software code is 97%
Python3, with the remainder being small bash scripts, Cypher queries, etc.

### subdirectory `data`

Text data files for the RTX system that are deployed using git are stored under
this subdirectory. There are only a few such files because the RTX POC software
obtaines most of the information that makes up the biomedical knowledge graph by
RESTfully querying web-based knowledge sources, rather than by loading flat files.

### subdirectory `team-private`

This subdirectory contains notes and other documents for sharing within the RTX team.

### License

The software that we would develop if awarded OT2 research support to build RTX
would be made publicly available, under the MIT open-source software license, in
the [RTX GitHub area](https://github.com/RTXteam/RTX).

### Dependencies outside of GitHub

- The RTX POC software depends on a SQLite cache file, `orangeboard.sqlite`. The
POC software can build this cache file if the cache file is not pre-installed by
the user; however, the POC software will build the knowledge graph much more
rapidly the first time, if our pre-built cache file (46 GB) is used. The
pre-built cache file is stored in Amazon S3
[(link; requires pre-arrangement for access)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ramseylab/ncats/ncats.saramsey.org/orangeboard.sqlite).

- Neo4j and Python modules: please see [the README file in the code subdirectory](https://github.com/dkoslicki/NCATS/blob/master/code/README.md)
for more information.


### Issue tracking

Our team makes extensive use of the GitHub Issues system for project
management. Browsing the open and (~100) closed
[RTX issues](https://github.com/dkoslicki/NCATS/issues) will provide a sense of
our team's workflow and organizational style, at least for a one-month POC
project.
